This is a very basic list of interesting or unusual words and forms, along with verse citations and sometimes attempted etymologies. It is not by any means comprehensive, in that not all words will be included, and not every token of a given word has been hunted down (usually I'll only give one citation).

/ə a a: ã: u: i: "ĭ"/ <u a â ô 8 ê i>. <ʷ ʸ> represent dropped /w y/; <ᴿ> represents a (presumed) dropped glide which cannot be identified.
