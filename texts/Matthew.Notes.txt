α, β.5.8: apparent <pehketeahoncheg> in both manuscript (more clearly in β; α may have a smudged <o>), but <o> is expected etymologically
α.5.34: text seems to have <ahqne>
α.5.42: text has <wehquetumukqnean>
α.6.17: second <s> of <kussequash> is conjectural.
α.9.14: text has <mtt metséog> for emended <mat metséog>
α.9.18: text has <pyeau> for emended <peyau>
α.9.21: text has <...n8wau ut wuttah,ut woh...>
α.9.33: text has <mat-|kaket8g> over a line break
α.10.1: text has <niskkeneungque> for emended <nishkeneungque>
α.12.29: exact diacritic over first <a> of <kuttámma> unclear, but acute seems most likely
α.12.39: text has <kukkinneasuouk> for second token of <kukkinneasuonk>
α.12.50: text appears to have <kesukqnt> for <kesukqut>
α.13.24: macron in <ogqueneūkqussu> looks more like an inverted breve, but <u> is unusually large; a macron seems very likely but not certain
13.30: Note <yó/yô pajeh> in both editions for 'until'; <nô/nó pajeh> would be expected. A Moheganism?
α.13.38: possibly spurious hyphen in text, as <wunnegen-wuskannem>, but difficult to say and may just be an ink splotch
α.13.52: <u> of <wuskéaiash> very faint
β.14.3: <ummittamwussen>...is <-en> a sign of an obviative possessor? (surely just 'he has her as a wife' as it appears to be in ɛ.14.4)
β.14.6: <pomugkóoh> may be <pomugkôoh> (but unlikely)--but Higgins has <pomug[kô]oh>--check another edition. Circumflex in <8sekêteaheuh> also missing from Higgins. β.14.6 may also (but probably doesn't) end in a comma rather than a period
α.14.7: possibly <kodtantámunit>
α.14.15: text has <wutttinnóuh>, with three <t>'s, for emended <wuttinnóuh>. Similarly with <attóónat> (text: <atttóónat>)
α.14.17: text has <wuntinouh> for emended <wuttinouh>
α.14.19: spurious line-hyphen in text, as <napanna-|tahshinash>
α.14.24: should <pannu wuttin> be one word or two? (currently one in backend, as <pannu$wuttin>)
α.14.28: circumflex of <woskêche> faint, and may be a grave
α.16.1: <a> of <kuhkinneasuonk> very faint and somewhat conjectural (find another scan?)
α.17.1: text has <wnnneemunoh> for emended <wunneemunoh>. <ô> in <kussonkôauudt> is very faint, and diacritic is conjectured.
