α, β.5.8: apparent <pehketeahoncheg> in both manuscript (more clearly in β; α may have a smudged <o>), but <o> is expected etymologically
α.5.34: text seems to have <ahqne>
α.5.42: text has <wehquetumukqnean>
α.6.17: second <s> of <kussequash> is conjectural.
α.9.14: text has <mtt metséog> for emended <mat metséog>
α.9.18: text has <pyeau> for emended <peyau>
α.9.21: text has <...n8wau ut wuttah,ut woh...>
α.9.33: text has <mat-|kaket8g> over a line break
α.10.1: text has <niskkeneungque> for emended <nishkeneungque>
α.12.29: exact diacritic over first <a> of <kuttámma> unclear, but acute seems most likely
α.12.39: text has <kukkinneasuouk> for second token of <kukkinneasuonk>
α.12.50: text appears to have <kesukqnt> for <kesukqut>
α.13.24: macron in <ogqueneūkqussu> looks more like an inverted breve, but <u> is unusually large; a macron seems very likely but not certain
13.30: Note <yó/yô pajeh> in both editions for 'until'; <nô/nó pajeh> would be expected. A Moheganism?
α.13.38: possibly spurious hyphen in text, as <wunnegen-wuskannem>, but difficult to say and may just be an ink splotch
α.13.52: <u> of <wuskéaiash> very faint
β.14.3: <ummittamwussen>...is <-en> a sign of an obviative possessor? (surely just 'he has her as a wife' as it appears to be in ɛ.14.4)
β.14.6: <pomugkóoh> may be <pomugkôoh> (but unlikely)--but Higgins has <pomug[kô]oh>--check another edition. Circumflex in <8sekêteaheuh> also missing from Higgins. β.14.6 may also (but probably doesn't) end in a comma rather than a period
α.14.7: possibly <kodtantámunit>
α.14.15: text has <wutttinnóuh>, with three <t>'s, for emended <wuttinnóuh>. Similarly with <attóónat> (text: <atttóónat>)
α.14.17: text has <wuntinouh> for emended <wuttinouh>
α.14.19: spurious line-hyphen in text, as <napanna-|tahshinash>
α.14.24: should <pannu wuttin> be one word or two? (currently one in backend, as <pannu$wuttin>)
α.14.28: circumflex of <woskêche> faint, and may be a grave
α.16.1: <a> of <kuhkinneasuonk> very faint and somewhat conjectural (find another scan?)
α.17.1: text has <wnnneemunoh> for emended <wunneemunoh>. <ô> in <kussonkôauudt> is very faint, and diacritic is conjectured.
α.18.15: <a> of <nôaush> extremely faint. Should this be considered one word?
α.18.19: text has <kuttinnnónnumw8> with three <n>'s preceding <ó>; emended here.
α.18.24: text has <anuntuhqohwonche> with a <u> missing after the <q> (restored in emendation)
α.18.34: some sort of diacritic over the third <a> of <sasamâkuhhuwaenuog>, but I cannot tell which; shape of letter seems most consistent with a circumflex or perhaps a grave. Circumflex in <nô> may be an acute, but is probably not.
α.20.1: text has <sohbog> for <sohhog>
α.20.28: first/second-to-last <o> of <8tinneumunneaôont> has some sort of diacritic per its shape, but cannot be pinned down with certainty. A circumflex seems plausible
α.21.2: first <a> of <otanamesit> extremely faint
α.21.7: acute in <quenoshóneau> may be a circumflex
α.21.8: text has <may nt> for first token of <may ut>. Possible diacritic (grave?) over <a> of <onkatogig>, but likely just heavy ink
α.21.12: first <e> of <kepuhteau> is extremely faint/missing in text
α.21.15: narrow space between <temple> and <ut> in <templeut>; difficult to tell whether this was intended as a word-space
α.21.30: first word appears to be <Koh> in text
α.21.38: faint diacritic (conjectured to be a grave, but perhaps a circumflex) probable over third/final <e> of <ohketeaèninnuog>
α.21.41: <wutonkquepaguanuh> emended from <wutonkqnepaguanuh>
α.22.6: possibly <kâh wuttunkquontamhéouh> with circumflex on <kâh> (check a third copy)
α.22.16: text has <ammay> for emended <ummay>
α.22.29: apparent <Panue> for <Panne> in text
α.23.2: text has <watappuonganit> for emended <wutappuonganit>
α.23.4: acute in <wussauunukqunáoash> may be spurious
23.18: In both α and β, <Altar ut> without hyphen over line-break, as <Altar|ut>. Treated as having a spurious word-space in both copies here
α.23.29: <eiantukeiyeuog> emended from text's <eitantukeiyeuog>, with spurious <t>
α.25.8: circumflex in <ôhtaash> possibly an acute
α.25.15: apparent spurious macron over <i> of <aninnumauoh>, as <anīnnumauoh>
α.26.27: possible grave over first <a> of <wuttattamwaitch>
α.26.29: unclear whether there's a comma after  <n8tattamo>
α.26.36: <ú> of <kodnetuhtaénúh> strongly resembles a tilde (this is probably nothing)
α.26.49: possible grave over first <a> of <Kutaaquompsinun >
